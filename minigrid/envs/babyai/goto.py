    ## Description

    Go to the red ball, single room, with distractors.
    The distractors are all grey to reduce perceptual complexity.
    This level has distractors but doesn't make use of language.

    ## Description

    Go to the red ball or to the blue ball.
    There is exactly one red or blue ball, and some distractors.
    The distractors are guaranteed not to be red or blue balls.
    Language is not required to solve this level.

    ## Mission Space

    "go to the {color} ball"

    {color} is the color of the box. Can be "red" or "blue".

    ## Observation Encoding

    - Each tile is encoded as a 3 dimensional tuple:
        `(OBJECT_IDX, COLOR_IDX, STATE)`
    - `OBJECT_TO_IDX` and `COLOR_TO_IDX` mapping can be found in
        [minigrid/minigrid.py](minigrid/minigrid.py)
    - `STATE` refers to the door state with 0=open, 1=closed and 2=locked

    ## Rewards

    A reward of '1 - 0.9 * (step_count / max_steps)' is given for success, and '0' for failure.

    ## Termination

    The episode ends if any one of the following conditions is met:

    1. The agent goes to the ball.
    2. Timeout (see `max_steps`).
