class DoorKeyEnv(MiniGridEnv):

    """
    ## Description

    This environment has a key that the agent must pick up in order to unlock a
    goal and then get to the green goal square. This environment is difficult,
    because of the sparse reward, to solve using classical RL algorithms. It is
    useful to experiment with curiosity or curriculum learning.

    ## Mission Space

    "use the key to open the door and then get to the goal"

    ## Action Space

    | Num | Name         | Action                    |
    |-----|--------------|---------------------------|
    | 0   | left         | Turn left                 |
    | 1   | right        | Turn right                |
    | 2   | forward      | Move forward              |
    | 3   | pickup       | Pick up an object         |
    | 4   | drop         | Unused                    |
    | 5   | toggle       | Toggle/activate an object |
    | 6   | done         | Unused                    |

    ## Observation Encoding

    - Each tile is encoded as a 3 dimensional tuple:
        `(OBJECT_IDX, COLOR_IDX, STATE)`
    - `OBJECT_TO_IDX` and `COLOR_TO_IDX` mapping can be found in
        [minigrid/minigrid.py](minigrid/minigrid.py)
    - `STATE` refers to the door state with 0=open, 1=closed and 2=locked

    ## Rewards

    A reward of '1 - 0.9 * (step_count / max_steps)' is given for success, and '0' for failure.

    ## Termination

    The episode ends if any one of the following conditions is met:

    1. The agent reaches the goal.
    2. Timeout (see `max_steps`).

    ## Registered Configurations

    - `MiniGrid-DoorKey-6x6-v0`
    - `MiniGrid-DoorKey-8x8-v0`
